Hamlet Wood has a special field set aside purely for pioneering activities and also hires out Pioneering Project Kits which come with all equipment, poles and instructions required.

There is a choice of nine Pioneering Project Kits which should be booked with the Warden for weekend or week long hire, but early booking is advised to avoid disappointment.
