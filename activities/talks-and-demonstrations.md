title: Talks and Demonstrations
---

### Woodland

By prior arrangement we can give a 1 hr talk and demonstration on the craft of cutting coppice woodland. We discuss how and why this is done and then show how the raw timber is then converted into fence posts etc and demonstrate the tools and equipment that are used.

### Nature & Wildlife

By prior arrangement, talks on the local wildlife and nature in the woodland can be provided

### Leathercraft

By prior arrangement, you can make your own leather woggle or key ring, perhaps stamp your belt. Use one of the many metal stamps or use the sets of letters we have available. This is like branding, but safer, without heat.
