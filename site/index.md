Hamlet Wood is situated on high ground only 2.5 miles south of Maidstone. The 27 acres of coppiced woodland consists mainly of chestnut and birch, with a mixture of many other varieties of trees.

The main camping is in separate clearings around a central activity field known as The Glade, as well as two other fields known as Cutbush and Cobtree. A permanent building, housing male and female toilets, washing facilities with hot water and a separate disabled toilet including a shower are available to all using the site.

Two buildings on site are available for hire for courses and conferences, for Pack holidays and Beaver sleepovers and as winter sleeping quarters and to Groups wishing to use their facilities whilst camping.
