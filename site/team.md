Hamlet Wood is staffed completely by volunteers who perform most of the maintenance and minor improvements on the site, the Service Team work at the site every Monday, apart from bank holidays.

Working partyâ€™s also work at the site every third Saturday of the month, mainly doing small scale coppicing and vegetation clearance work. Over the years the Service Team have also acquired experience in tree planting and woodland skills which involves making our own fence posts and stakes, one piece mallets and tent pegs.
