As part of the Scout's centenary celebrations, the Woodland Trust and the Scout Association formed a partnership to provide members of the Scout movement with a number of opportunities to learn about, and engage in, woodland conservation

Over the next few years, the Woodland Trust, the UK's leading woodland conservation charity, will offer a series of activities and events for packs. This initiative is part of the Trust's Tree For All campaign, which aims to involve one million children in planting 12 million trees.
