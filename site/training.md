The site has been used for training purposes since its opening and in 1968, when the first Wood Badge training course was held. In 1982 the new Kenneth Loveland Training Centre was opened and the site has been used ever since for County, District and Group training courses.

If you think that this would be a suitable venue for your training course, please speak to the Warden to find out the full range of facilities that Hamlet Wood can provide for you.
