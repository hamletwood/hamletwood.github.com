The Open Air Chapel opening ceremony was held on 7th May 2000. The chapel was conceived as a millennium project, an open area was levelled, and a ring of yew trees planted to provide a hedge boundary for the chapel. A gateway, built of green oak was also installed as well as a table to act as an alter.

The chapel is available for use by all campers, but if you require a particular time for a service, it would be as well to book with the Warden.
