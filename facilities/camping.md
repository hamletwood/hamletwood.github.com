### The Glade

Camping is in clearings, larger ‘A’ sites big enough for a small party, Pack, Troop or Unit and smaller ‘B’ sites for patrol type camping around a central activity field known as ‘The Glade’. Each of the A & B sites has a permanent camp kitchen area.

Marquee / Mess Tent areas have been created in the woodland adjacent to sites A1 and A6 plus the two Camping Fields. They have all been laid with up to two inches of wood chips and by using these areas campers will free up the camping areas and prevent too much wear and mud in times of bad weather.
