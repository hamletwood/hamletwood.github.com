title: The Vanstone Headquarters Building (VHQ)
---

The Vanstone HQ building is available for hire for courses and conferences, Pack Holidays and as winter sleeping quarters. The building is also available for hire to Groups wishing to use their facilities whilst camping.

The VHQ includes a main room (48’ x 25’), two Leaders Rooms (with 4 bunk beds in each), a large lobby for coats and boots and a fully equipped kitchen. At the moment the building has to be used in conjunction with the main toilet block, although plans are well advanced for the addition of a male and female toilet suite with showers and fully designed with disabled facilities, to be attached to the building.

There are 30 ex-army wooden framed camp beds for young people to use for sleeping on in the main hall. The kitchen has a six burner stove with a large oven, microwave oven, 6 slice toaster, water boiler, all the pots, pans and other utensils you could possibly need and enough china and cutlery for up to 50 people. You only need to bring your own food!
