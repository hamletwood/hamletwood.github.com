A 30 foot (9 metre) high Climbing and abseil Tower can be hired with, or without equipment. You will need to provide your own qualified instructors.

If you do not have a qualified instructor, help may be able to be provided by one of the suitably qualified instructors with the County. Use the link to the Kent County Scout website on the Links page to contact one of the County Land Activities Team.
